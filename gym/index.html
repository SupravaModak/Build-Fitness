                    <b>A</b>t Build Fitness, we believe that fitness and wellbeing are the cornerstones of a full and
                    vibrant life. Established in 2002, we began our journey as a family-owned business dedicated to
                    providing exceptional gym equipment at affordable prices. But, we dreamed bigger than just being an
                    ordinary fitness equipment supplier; we aspired to lead the industry.

                    Two decades later, we are proud to have transformed Gym and Fitness into one of Australia's premier
                    online retailers of fitness equipment. We've moved beyond just supplying gear – we've become
                    advocates for fitness, wellbeing and life enrichment. Our commitment to excellence is reflected not
                    only in the quality equipment we provide but also in the lives we've improved.

                    Our real success lies in the thousands of customers we've empowered to live longer, more joyful, and
                    healthier lives. We're more than just a fitness company – we're your partners in health, your
                    cheerleaders on the sideline, motivating you to reach your personal fitness goals.

                    <p>Boiled chicken is an effective way to add protein to your diet without excessive fat or
                        cholesterol. A 3-ounce piece of skinless chicken breast contains 29 grams of protein, more than
                        an equally sized piece of top round beef, turkey breast or salmon.The main benefit of boiled
                        chicken is that it is low in fat and calories, making it an ideal choice for those looking to
                        maintain a healthy diet.<br> However, boiled chicken can be bland and unappetizing, as it lacks
                        the
                        flavor of other cooking methods such as frying or roasting.</p>

                    <p>A piece of fresh bread to accompany your salad… sounds yummy, right? However, if it's French
                        bread with garlic butter, white bread with olive oil, or pizza bread with chili oil, you'll end
                        up with some extra calories. Tip: Eat your salad with 2 slices of bread, or 1 bread roll – and
                        choose whole grain, if possible.<br> Bread provides carbohydrates and can help make the meal
                        more filling, while salad offers a refreshing and nutritious contrast.</p>

                        post-workout.<br> Dried apricots are a great choice as they are rich in potassium, which helps
                        maintain proper muscle function. Dates are another excellent option due to their high
                        carbohydrate content, which provides quick energy.</p>

                        slowly providing sustained energy throughout your workout.<br> Eating a diet high in fruits and

                        Organic juices can also serve as great pre workout meals.<br> Juicing also can give the

                    <p>Your body needs protein to repair and grow muscle that is broken down during exercise. Regular
                        exercise will mean you need a little bit more protein than usual.Overall, a high-protein diet
                        appears to increase muscle accretion and fat loss and may have beneficial effects on bone when
                        combined with exercise. Pre-sleep protein is a viable strategy to help achieve total daily
                        protein goals.<br>Eating adequate amounts of protein helps you maintain your muscle mass and
                        promotes muscle growth when you do strength training. </p>
